The following is some Julia code to visualize one-dimensional sequences with four symbols onto a two-dimensional plane.
Currently works for DNA sequences with four symbols corresponding to nucleotides (C,G,T,A).
The resulting CGR is a square.

Further work: expanding to different numbers of symbols in the sequence
